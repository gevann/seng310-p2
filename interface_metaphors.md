#Interface Metaphors

The main interface metaphor employed by the application is that of the search engine, which, as the
book states, is "meant to conjure up the essence of the process of finding relevant information". In this way,
the familiar concept of an engine - a physical object designed to enact heavy processing for some
desired result - is combined with the new concept of reducing the set of all UVIC courses to those
most likely to be relevant to the current user.
