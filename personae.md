#Personae

_Taken from phase 1._

##Jenna

Jenna is a first-year Social Sciences student who is just getting used to the UVic website’s online tools. She has only registered for courses once before starting at UVic and found the entire process to be confusing, disjointed, and outdated. Because she is a new student, she doesn’t really have experience with any other post-secondary websites; this means she has decided her difficulties are not due to the site. Jenna doesn’t like to use her laptop to check the UVic site, so most of her visits are from her cell phone. The UVic website’s mobile experience is really frustrating for Jenna because she can’t get to the right half of the page in most instances.

##Paul

Paul is a fifth-year Engineering student who transferred to the University of Victoria from Simon Fraser University in his second year. He is very used to the UVic website by now; Paul has seen the main page go through a redesign, while the background registration pages have been left virtually untouched. Since he’s registered for courses several times he has an excellent grasp of the steps needed to complete the task. He knows in order to get all the features of the site he must use his laptop, but he can’t help but notice that his old school’s (SFU) website seems to be more modern and student-focused.


##Kelly

Kelly is a mature student who has come back to school after working for 25 years. When she originally went to school back in the 1990’s, there was no way to register for courses except by paper. Since students do almost all of their applications, registration, and course selection online, Kelly wants a way to learn quickly and easily how to find courses she’s interested in. Since she hasn’t been at school for so long, Kelly doesn’t know exactly what kind of courses she wants to take. Although she’s currently in the Business faculty, her degree plan calls for 10-12 different electives in her first two years. Since they should be in a variety of topics, Kelly is facing the task of going through UVic’s course calendar in its entirety; this is a daunting task. She wishes she had a way to find out what other students have recommended, what ratings they gave each course, and how it will affect her credits and eventual graduation.
