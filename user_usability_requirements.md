#Usability/User Experience Goals as Received:

##Usability Goals

1. The website should be able to be used on any sized device. Making sure you
don’t have to use the same resolution of webpage that is used on a laptop
that would be used on a mobile device.

2. The website should not let you sign up for multiple classes at the same
time, and not let the user sign up for classes that they are not allowed to
be enrolled in, like classes they don’t have prerequisites for or are only allowed by particular departments.

3. The website should offer recommendations for required or elective courses
based on area of study and past courses taken (respectively). This will allow
for a more interactive experience that may also aid students in deciding
their semester’s schedule.

4. The website should offer an “auto-scheduling” feature that takes into
account which courses you’d like to take, while also using data from a small
questionnaire form. For example, some questions the site may ask is “do you
prefer morning or evening classes?” or “what is the earliest start time you
would like?”

##User Experience Goals

1. It should be fast and have very subtle animations. The user is signing up
for classes and has a purpose, that they do not want to spend a lot of time on.

2. The tabs must be visible and large enough to be able to distinguish them
from other tabs, and easily clickable. When you are signing up for classes
there is a lot of information that must be visible. Making the font easy to
read and large enough to read is a user experience goal.

3. Information should be available to the user either at-a-glance or by
clicking on a course. With the current setup, finding information like time
of lecture, length, professor name, class size, available spots, waitlists,
and labs are all spread across multiple pages.

4. The course selection process should revolve around a visual timetable
setup instead of text-based entries as of now. For instance, adding a course
should be as simple as adding a new event on your personal calendar. The
site, based on its intelligent auto-scheduling, should be able to give
students a rough outline of their upcoming semester. But, this shouldn’t get
in the way of students being able to tweak and edit the schedule themselves.
