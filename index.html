          <a class="anchor" id="concept"></a>
          <h1 class="page-header" id="conceptual-model">Conceptual Model</h1>
          <p>The application, based on <a href="https://grahamcmacdonald.wixsite.com/seng310b01p5phase1">this original design document</a>, is designed to be
            first and foremost a tool for class registration at the University of Victoria (UVIC), with secondary functions of displaying the student's class
            schedule as well as listing the textbooks required or suggested for each course the student is registered in. An ancillary usage of the
            application is a course search, which is integrated directly into the registration system as a necessary first step.</p>
          <p>For the primary function of course registration, the application takes as input a user-generated string, such as 'first year after 10am', and
            displays an ordered series of suggested courses to match the given criteria. The suggested courses are shown alongside the user's current class
            schedule. A detailed view of the course listing is provided to the user should they select any course, at the same time the course being
            inspected is superimposed upon the user's current schedule at the appropriate time. From the course-details the user can save the course for
            later (which places the course in the user's schedule but does not register the user in the course), or register for the course. This primary
            feature of the application is designed to fit the conversing-style conceptual model of the search engine; the search bar acts as user input as in
            most other search engines, while the courses are displayed in a list ordered by best-fit, in the same manner as the common search engine's
            output. Additionally, the results list is designed to fit the exploring and browsing style conceptual model just as online search-engine websites
            are. This is done in order to provide a set of perceived affordances (learned conventions) to the user - those which they employ to use internet
            search engines - which in turn is designed to increase both the learnability and memorability of the application.</p>
          <p>The schedule-viewer secondary function is designed with the conceptual model of a physical calendar. It represents days as the columns of a
            grid, times as the rows. Entries in the schedule are two-dimensional squares blocking out the grid-pattern of the calendar with an outlined
            shape, background colour, and label, making use of the concept model of a paper note placed upon a physical calendar. Both of these models fall
            into the browsing style of concept models. While the schedule displayed alongside the search results is similar to the one previously described,
            it is nevertheless a manipulating-style conceptual model, owing to the fact that the user can interact with the items displayed on the schedule
            via direct manipulation.</p>
          <p>The final usage of the application - displaying the relevant textbooks given the user's registered courses - follows the conceptual model of the
            list. Each entry of the list represents a single textbook. The attributes of each entry include the book title, author's list, the status of book
            regarding it's usage in the course (whether it is mandatory or suggested), the title of the course it is used in, and the name of the professor
            teaching said course. Users are able to get an additionally detailed view of the book by selecting its entry in the list. This detailed view has
            the additional attributes of an image of the book's cover, any subtitles of the book, the location of the book in the bookstore, and the
            availability of used copies in the bookstore. None of this information can be changed through this view, as such, the concept model here falls
            under the category of exploration and browsing, rather than direct manipulation.</p>

          <a class="anchor" id="data"></a>
          <h1 class="page-header" id="data-required">Data Required</h1>
          <p>The application has multiple sources of necessary data. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>all courses offered at UVIC</li>
            <li>user transcripts</li>
            <li>user course of study</li>
            <li>all course requirements, in full, for each course of study offered by UVIC</li>
            <li>and user given search queries</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="courses-offered-at-uvic">Courses offered at UVIC</h2>
          <p>The application's primary function is provide UVIC students a means of finding and registering for courses at the university. In order to
            achieve this goal, the application requires the set of all courses being offered by UVIC for the next term eligible for registration, at the
            least. Without this data it is impossible for the application to present available courses to the student.</p>

          <h2 id="user-transcripts-course-of-study-and-the-program-requirements-for-each-course-of-study-at-uvic">User transcripts, course of study, and the program requirements for each course of study at UVIC</h2>
          <p>The application makes use of the user's transcripts in order to suggest courses. In addition to this, the application makes use of the detailed
            requirements for each course of study provided by UVIC. These two sets of data are necessary for the application in order for it to provide
            suggested courses to the users, such as suggesting a course which is required in the course of study - a detail that comes from the set of all
            program requirements at uvic - yet which the user has not already taken and has the necessary prerequisites for - a detail which comes from the
            user's transcripts and course of study.</p>

          <h2 id="user-provided-search-input">User provided search input</h2>
          <p>The application is primarily geared towards enabling the user to quickly find (and register for) courses relevant to them. This goal
            necessitates the need for user input; the user provides additional criteria for the application to use to suggest courses, such as a faculty they
            wish to take a course in, a year, or a time of day for the course to begin after. Without user input, the application would degrade from a search
            engine to a list.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-6 col-xs-offset-1">
          <a class="anchor" id="interface"></a>
          <h1 class="page-header" id="interface-metaphors">Interface Metaphors</h1>
          <p>
            The main interface metaphor employed by the application is that of the search engine, which, as the book states, is &quot;meant to conjure up
            the essence of the process of finding relevant information&quot;. In this way, the familiar concept of an engine - a physical object designed to
            enact heavy processing for some desired result - is combined with the new concept of reducing the set of all UVIC courses to those most likely to
            be relevant to the current user.

          <h1 class="page-header" id="modifications-to-phase-1">Modifications to Phase 1</h1>
          <p>
            The document which this document is based upon has several flaws. As such, some modifications and
            assumptions were necessary to completed this document.
          </p>
          <h3 id="textbook-exchange">Textbook exchange</h3>
          <p>The original document mentions the application having a textbook exchange; however, under the listing of the key features of the application the
            original document makes no note of a textbook exchange. Taking this into consideration, alongside the already-significant scope or designing a
            user interface for a course search, registration, schedule viewer, and textbook lising application, the textbook exchange was removed from
            further consideration and is not included in this design document.
          </p>
          <p>This results in the exclusion of the scenario of using the textbook exchange.</p>

          <h3 id="user-profiles">User profiles</h3>
          <p>The fourth user profile, Zaphod BeebleBrox, is not included in this design document. In addition to being, in our opinion, written as a joke,
            this user profile primarily provides detailed information about how the user arrived on Earth and is not generalizable.</p>

          <h3 id="user-requirements">User requirements</h3>
          <p>The original document included both user-experience goals and usability goals under user requirements. However, no template was used for these
            requirements. Additionally, none of the requirements make mention of any of the user-experience or usability goals as they were discussed in
            class and examined in the textbook. As a result, wach user requirement was examined and adapted; some were found to be functional requirements
            rather than design requirements (these were dropped form this document), others were broken out into multiple user-experience and usability goals
            that when taken together could arguably satisfy the user requirement as written, others still were simple dropped from consideration after being
            found to be applied to the user of the application rather than on the application itself.</p>

          <h5 class="bold">Clear, concise functionality of the class registration system</h5>
          <p>This requirement was broken out into focuses on:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>learnability</li>
            <li>feedback</li>
            <li>percieved affordances</li>
            <li>consistency</li>
          </ul>

          <p>to satisfy the notion of 'clear', and:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>efficiency</li>
          </ul>

          <p>to satisfy the notion of 'concise'.</p>

          <h5 class="bold">Mobile version of the site robust enough to do everything (or most things) the main version can</h5>
          <p>
            This requirement was dropped from consideration. A mobile design is here considered to be an entirely separate design process, requiring an
            entirely new design document. Additionally, the problems which inspire this requirement, as mentioned in the original document, are actually
            anti-features; the inability of mobile users to zoom the website to fit there screen. No including this anti-feature is viewed as sufficient for
            making the site comply with this requirement without introducing an entire sub-project.
          </p>

          <h5 id="modern-user-friendly-redesign-of-the-uvic-registration-pages">Modern, user friendly redesign of the UVic registration pages</h5>
          <p>No design requirements were adapted from the term 'modern' as it is too general to extrapolate from without significant experience in the field.</p>
          <p>To satisfy the notion of 'user friendly', this requirement was broken out into focuses on:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>percieved affordances</li>
            <li>consistency</li>
            <li>learnability</li>
            <li>memorability</li>
            <li>utility</li>
            <li>safety</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It is noted that these overlap with those extracted from the notion of 'clear'; we argue that an application which is clear for the user is as a
            result user friendly if it also is of high utility and ensures safety features are in place for users.
          </p>

          <h5 id="intelligent-course-selection-system-based-on-suggestions">Intelligent course selection system based on suggestions</h5>
          <p>This requirement was dropped for consideration after being determined to be a technical functional requirement rather than an interface design requirement.</p>

          <h5 id="database-should-be-able-to-recommend-courses-based-on-degree-and-be-able-to-check-with-a-students-transcript-for-past-courses">Database should be able to recommend courses based on degree and be able to check with a student’s transcript for past courses</h5>
          <p>This requirement was dropped for the same reason as that of the above.</p>

          <h5 id="visual-based-class-search-and-registration-system-to-allow-easier-registration-for-non-english-speakers.">Visual based class search and registration system to allow easier registration for non-english speakers.</h5>
          <p>This requirement was dropped from consideration as the features of the application require text-based input, and it is not possible to verify if there is enough emphasis on non-textual elements to be considered visually based. Additionally, preferring visual cues to transfer information whenever it is of benefit to the users is considered to be covered by <em>utility</em> and <em>perceived affordances</em>.</p>

          <h5 id="a-k-12-education">A K-12 education</h5>
          <p>This requirement was dropped due to the fact that it is a requirement of the user and not a requirement of the system.</p>

          <h3 id="jenna">Jenna</h3>
          <p>Jenna is a first-year Social Sciences student who is just getting used to the UVic website’s online tools. She has only registered for courses
            once before starting at UVic and found the entire process to be confusing, disjointed, and outdated. Because she is a new student, she doesn’t
            really have experience with any other post-secondary websites; this means she has decided her difficulties are not due to the site. Jenna doesn’t
            like to use her laptop to check the UVic site, so most of her visits are from her cell phone. The UVic website’s mobile experience is really
            frustrating for Jenna because she can’t get to the right half of the page in most instances.</p>

          <h3 id="paul">Paul</h3>
          <p>Paul is a fifth-year Engineering student who transferred to the University of Victoria from Simon Fraser University in his second year. He is
            very used to the UVic website by now; Paul has seen the main page go through a redesign, while the background registration pages have been left
            virtually untouched. Since he’s registered for courses several times he has an excellent grasp of the steps needed to complete the task. He knows
            in order to get all the features of the site he must use his laptop, but he can’t help but notice that his old school’s (SFU) website seems to be more modern and student-focused.</p>

          <h3 id="kelly">Kelly</h3>
          <p>Kelly is a mature student who has come back to school after working for 25 years. When she originally went to school back in the 1990’s, there
            was no way to register for courses except by paper. Since students do almost all of their applications, registration, and course selection
            online, Kelly wants a way to learn quickly and easily how to find courses she’s interested in. Since she hasn’t been at school for so long, Kelly
            doesn’t know exactly what kind of courses she wants to take. Although she’s currently in the Business faculty, her degree plan calls for 10-12
            different electives in her first two years. Since they should be in a variety of topics, Kelly is facing the task of going through UVic’s course
            calendar in its entirety; this is a daunting task. She wishes she had a way to find out what other students have recommended, what ratings they
            gave each course, and how it will affect her credits and eventual graduation.</p>

          <h1 class="page-header" id="scenarios-and-use-cases">Scenarios and Use Cases</h1>
          <p><em>Modified from phase 1</em>.</p>

          <h3 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1</h3>
          <p>Jenna has never registered for class before. She begins by logging in to the application and choosing the registration section. Due to her
            inexperience at UVic, she is unsure what courses she has to take. She decides to see what the search will do for her, and hits enter on an empty
            search bar. The search displays multiple courses, but she is primarily concerned with requirements, and navigates to the wants to get a list of
            the suggested required courses for her. She clicks on the 'required' filter, and adds some suggested required courses to her schedule. During
            this process she tries to add a course which conflicts with another course in her schedule already, however, since this is a popular first year
            course there is another offering which does not conflict with her schedule which is suggested to her. She accepts the suggestion. After this
            suggestion, Jenna notices a course which looks interesting, but she is not sure if she will want to take it his semester. She askes the system to save it for her in her schedule without registering for it yet.</p>

          <h3 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2</h3>
          <p>Paul only has his last few classes remaining and is not worried at all about getting into them. He takes his time, building his schedule slowly,
            setting his earlier start time as 9:30am under the settings. Since Paul was not able to begin registering until two days after the
            open-registration date, one of his courses is already full. When he tries to register, the system informs him that there is no room left in the
            course, and suggests that he put himself on the waitlist. Paul accepts the suggestion. After registering for one more course, Paul decides he
            does not want to be in the first course anymore. He views the details of it from the schedule, choosing to drop the course and have it downgraded
            to a saved course. After thinking it over, he decides that his decision is final and chooses to delete the saved course from his schedule altogether.</p>

          <h3 id="scenario-3">Scenario 3</h3>
          <p>Kelly knows what classes she needs but not what she wants to actually take. She logs in and checks out the electives tab of the search results.
            She adds an elective to her time table and the system tells her that the elective conflicts with a course already on her schedule. Since there
            are no other offerings of the course, the system suggests either aborting or swapping the conflicting course for the elective. Kelly really wants
            to get into the elective, worried that such a popular course will be quicker to fill up than the unexciting course it conflicts with. She opts
            for the system to automatically drop her from the original course and enroll her in the new course. The system notifies her of the success, and
            asks her if she wants to undo the action or accept. Kelly regrets her decision, and chooses to undo the action.</p>

          <h3 id="scenario-4">Scenario 4</h3>
          <p><em>Modified from phase 1</em>.</p>
          <p>Jenna cannot remember where or when her next class is. She logs in to the application and views her schedule to get the information.</p>

          <h3 id="scenario-5">Scenario 5</h3>
          <p>Kelly is registered for courses, and wants to purchase her books. She logs in to the application and views the book list for her registered courses.</p>

          <ol type="1">
            <li>The website should be able to be used on any sized device. Making sure you don’t have to
              use the same resolution of webpage that is used on a laptop that would be used on a mobile device.</li>
            <li>The website should not let you sign up for multiple classes at the same time, and not let
              the user sign up for classes that they are not allowed to be enrolled in, like classes they
              don’t have prerequisites for or are only allowed by particular departments.</li>
            <li>The website should offer recommendations for required or elective courses based on area of
              study and past courses taken (respectively). This will allow for a more interactive
              experience that may also aid students in deciding their semester’s schedule.</li>
            <li>The website should offer an “auto-scheduling” feature that takes into account which courses
              you’d like to take, while also using data from a small questionnaire form. For example, some
              questions the site may ask is “do you prefer morning or evening classes?” or “what is the
              earliest start time you would like?”</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="user-experience-goals">User Experience Goals</h2>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>It should be fast and have very subtle animations. The user is signing up for classes and has a purpose, that they do not want to spend a lot of time on.</li>
            <li>The tabs must be visible and large enough to be able to distinguish them from other tabs, and easily clickable. When you are signing up
              for classes there is a lot of information that must be visible. Making the font easy to read and large enough to read is a user experience goal.</li>
            <li>Information should be available to the user either at-a-glance or by clicking on a course. With the current setup, finding information
              like time of lecture, length, professor name, class size, available spots, waitlists, and labs are all spread across multiple pages.</li>
            <li>The course selection process should revolve around a visual timetable setup instead of text-based entries as of now. For instance, adding
              a course should be as simple as adding a new event on your personal calendar. The site, based on its intelligent auto-scheduling, should be
              able to give students a rough outline of their upcoming semester. But, this shouldn’t get in the way of students being able to tweak and edit the schedule themselves.</li>

            <p>
              Here we present screenshots of the purposed design, representing a flow through the usage of the application covering
              each use case. For brevity, rather than stepping through each use case and showing the corresponding images,
              which would require a significant repetition of images shown, the flow will continue in sequence through the images and
              explain when a use case is being covered by an image (or set of images) in the detailed text presented with each image,
              along with the reasoning behind various choices illustrated in the design.

            <p>
              For fonts, the suggested font is Helvetica Neue. This was chosen because it is widely used for internet applications due to its default

              The user navigates to the log in page (pictured), where they are presented with

              Here we follow the use case of adding a course. The user begins by selecting the registration
              option. The use of three large buttons here reflects a conscious choice to remaing within the
              limits of short term memory as suggested by Donald Norman, while providing a percieved affordance
              of pressing.

            <h3>Main search page.</h3>
            <p>
              The main search page is purposefully sparse. There are only four options provided to the user.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>navigating to their personal home page via the <em>you@uvic.ca</em> link</li>

              Again the design makes use both of purposeful restriction of the available actions,
              intended to aid the user through <em>constraints</em>, while providing a familiar
              interface metaphor of the search engine. This metaphor, including its commonality,
              affords the user a chance to use knowledge in the world to comprehend the application
              rather than having to learn how to interpret an unfamiliar interface. This was done
              to ensure the application adhered to a high degree of learnability.

            <h3>Basic search results.</h3>
            <p>
              Here we finish the use case of submitting a search. The user, on the previous page,
              entered a search string into the search bar, submitted a blank search, or chose to
              get suggestions without input. The system presents the best matching classes for the
              user in a vertical list alongside an in interactive interpretation of the user's
              current schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              The list metaphor was chosen to allow the user to intuit that the order of the
              items matters -- like a to-do list has the most crucial entry at first, the
              most recommended classes are at the top of the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entries themselves make use of the cultural constraint of traffic light
              colours; red is used to illustrate that a class is required by the users current
              course of study, green represents an unrestricted elective, and yellow indicates
              the partial restriction of a course that can fit a specific elective criterion.
              Following this cultural constraint allows the design to make more use of
              memorability as a way of reducing the amount of learning required (thereby increasing
              the learnability as well).
            </p>
            <p>
              Feedback is provided to the user by the ordering of the list, the status of the
              class in the course of study, as well as by the highlighting of the breadth of the
              search results being shown (here we see that all types of results are shown).

            <h3>Inspecting a listed course.</h3>
            <p>
              The user selects a course from the suggestions provided, and the system displays
              the course details, along with a set of course-related options. Amongst the courses
              detailed view is visual representation of the course on the user's current schedule.
              The enteries used for this representation are modeled after the concept of notes placed
              upon a physical calendar without being directly written in to it. This metaphor puts the
              user in mind of the impermanence of the display, and is illustrated through a drop-shadow
              and slight enlargement of the entry in an effort to make them appear floating on top
              of the calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actions available to the user in this view are all class-centric. This simplifies
              the situation for the user by constraining the next actions they can to to only those
              which apply to the most immediately preceeding action. Here that includes:
            </p>

              When the user hovers on the checkmark icon of the course entry in their schedule, the system
              displays additional information, as a tooltip, explaining that the user is registered in the
              course. This is combined with the colouring of the course entry in the calendar to provide

              When the user tries to register in a course that conflicts with another, an extra
              step is required -- a forcing function -- to purposefully make the process more
              difficult in an effort to protect the user from being able to mistake the current
              process for the more common process of registering for a course without any conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intermediate step makes further use of the cultural connotations of the colour red,
              as well was text written in all capital letters, to indicate a warning of to user of
              a potentially destructive action. The user is presented with the updated option of
              dropping the original course and simultanously registering in the new course, or aborting
              the option altogther. This joint option was provided to keep the application efficient;
              since an intermediate step was included in the form of a forcing function, the user is
              provided a way to do both actions (dropping and registering) at the same time rather than
              requiring them to do each in sequence.

              The user selects the desired class from the list, and is shown the course details view,

              The icon of a human in the top row of the class details, normally black, has been coloured

            <h3>Dropping a course.</h3>
            <p>
              After having selected a course which they are currently registered in, the user was provided
              a detailed view, with the option of dropping the course (previous image). The image shown here
              is the immediate result of selecting the drop option.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the drop and register case, here there is no forcing function. This was a deliberate
              choice. The act of dropping a course in the case comes from selection of the course in
              the user's schedule, which is different from the beginning steps of registering for a course
              in the course search results. This difference in approach reduces the chances of the user
              making a capture error, as Norman calls them. Because of this, and the goal of ensuring that
              the application be efficient ('user friendly'), the choice was made to forgo the use of a
              forcing function, opting instead to rely entirely on the saftey of the system provided by
              the prompt shown.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result on the schedule can be seen behind the prompt; the system has down graded the
              entry in the schedule from a registered course to a saved course. This is a further
              layer of safety, from the saved course entry the user has the chance to undo the drop even
              if they have dismissed the prompt shown.

              The prompt is dismissed, and the newly-downgraded course is left in the calendar where
              the registered course used to be.

            <h3>Unsaving a course.</h3>
            <p>
              This completes the use case of unsaving a course. The users selects a saved course from
              their schedule and is provided the opportunity to register for it, unsave it, or dismiss
              the prompt. The option to register for a course in this way both provides a safety
              feature for dropping a course (which first downgrades it to a saved course) as well as
              enabling the user to register for a saved course directly rather than using the saved
              entry as a reminder of what course to search and register for. The goal here was again
              efficiency.

              Here we see the results of choosing to unsave a course. The system removes the entry
              from the schedule without prompt. Unsaving a course was not seen as destructive enough
              to warrant extra confirmations, and in the interest of reducing the intrusiveness of
              feedback overall, the decision was made to unsave a course without question.

              From here we begin the user case of seeking similar courses to some given course.
              This begins with selecting a course, either from the search results or the schedule.
              The thinking was that by making use of the course items already displayed to the user,
              the application could avoid requiring the user to enter full course details in the
              search bar, thereby keeping the application efficient while providing good utility.

              selecting the similar courses link on the detailed course view. To increase learnability,
              the application populates the search bar with a search string which would have achieved
              the same results, allowing the user the opportunity to better learn how to make use
              of the search functionality directly.

              begins when the user selects the button in the top right of the screen, which has both
              a gear icon to convey the common notion of settings, and a down carat icon, indicating
              that it is a drop-down menu. From the menu, the user can select settings for a range

              Once on the settings page, the user has two modes of interaction, toggling and
              radio buttons -- both of which are common to forms across the internet. These
              methods were chosen to provide the cultural constraints associated with their usage:
              for the toggles, the user is able to enable or disable a feature (here start and end
              time restrictions); for the radio buttons, the user is able to select multiple items
              at once to apply the given action to (exluding or preferring).
